"""HumanProxy agent with continuation-aware message handling.

Extends akgentic-core's UserProxy to provide team-aware human interaction with
automatic answer routing through continuation chains. Enables human-in-the-loop
workflows where agents can request human input and receive answers that properly
route back through multi-agent chains.
